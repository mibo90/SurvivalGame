# Svelto Entity Component System 2.0
=====================================

Real Entity-Component-System for c#. Enables to write encapsulated, decoupled, maintainable, highly efficient, data oriented, cache friendly, multi-threaded, code without pain. Although the framework is platform agnostic, it comes with several unity extensions. 
you can find a working example to learn how to use the framework here:

## Examples

* **Survival Example (Unity)**: https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto-ECS-Example (including article)
* **Vanilla Example (.Net Standard/.Net Core)**: https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.ECS.Examples.Vanilla (including article)
* **Entities as struct, cache friendly data oriented code:** https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.ECS.Examples.CacheFriendlyECSWithEntityStructs (including article)

**The perfect companion for Svelto.ECS is Svelto.Tasks to run the logic of the Systems even on other threads!**

## How to clone

The folders Svelto.ECS, Svelto.Tasks and Svelto.Common, where present, are submodules pointing to the relavite repositories. If you find them empty, you need to update them through the submodule command. Check some instructions here: https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.ECS.Vanilla.Example/wiki

**Note: don't beat yourself up if you find Svelto.ECS hard to use at first. The framework is very light in features, but it forces the use of a new coding paradigm and shifting code paradigm is hard! I will try to clarify all the concepts writing more and more articles**
