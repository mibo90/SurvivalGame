/// Before to start a review of Svelto.ECS terminologies:
/// - Entity:
///     it must be a real and concrete entity that you can explain
///     in terms of game design. The name of each entity should reflect
///     a specific concept from the game design domain
/// - IComponents:
///     Components must be seen as data holders. There are implementing
///     exceptions, but logically it must be still see as a group
///     of readable or writeable data.
///     In Svelto.ECS components are always interfaces declaring
///     Setters and Getters of ValueTypes. DispatchOnSet
///     and DispatchOnChange must not be seen as events, but
///     as pushing of data instead of data polling, similar
///     to the concept of DataBinding.
/// - Implementors:
///     Being components interfaces, they must be implemented through
///     Implementors. The relation Implementors to Components
///     is not 1:1 so that you can, if logic, group several
///     components in one implementor. This allows to easily
///     share data between components. Implementors also act
///     as bridge between the platform and Svelto.ECS.
///     Since Components can hold only value types, Implementors
///     are the objects that can interact directly with the platform
///     objects, I.E.: RigidBody, Transform and so on.
///     Note: IComponents must hold only valuetypes for
///     code design purposes and not optmization purposes.
///     The reason is that all the logic must lie in the engines
///     so Components cannot hold references to instances that can
///     expose functions with logic.
/// - Engines:
///     Where all the logic lies. Engines operates on EntityViews
/// - EntityViews:
///     EntityViews maps EntityComponents. The Engines can't
///     access directly to each entity (as a single set of components), but
///     through a component sets defined by EntityView.
///     They act as a component filters and expose only the entity components
///     that the Engine is interested in.
///     EntityViews are actually defined by the need of the Engine so they
///     come together with the engine and in the same namespace of the engine.
/// - EntityStructs:
///     In order to write Data Oriented Cache Friendly code, Svelto.ECS
///     also support EntityStructs. Please check other examples to
///     understand how to use them. However know that this kind of
///     optimizations is very limited to special circumstances
///     so the flexibility of EntityViews is most of the times what you need.
/// - EntityDescriptors:
///     Gives a way to formalize your Entity in svelto.ECS, it also
///     groups the EntityViews that must be generated once the
///     Entity is built
